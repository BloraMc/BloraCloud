# BloraCloud Cloud API

The **Cloud Folder API** allows users to upload public content that does not fit into other categories and fetch it via API requests, minimizing local storage usage.

* **Content Upload & Access:** Users can upload content (e.g., sound effects) and retrieve it programmatically.

* **Content Policy:**

  * Copyrighted content **may be uploaded**, but **commercial use is strictly prohibited**.
  * Any content that receives a **valid copyright claim** will be **removed immediately without prior notice**.
  * Preferably, upload **open-source or copyright-free content** to avoid issues.

> The API is intended for public, non-commercial content sharing while respecting copyright law.
